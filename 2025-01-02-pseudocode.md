# write a pseudocode that 
# 1-finds and returns all the odd numbers between two defined numbers 
# 2- summs all these odd numbers

# enter a range of numbers i = [a;b]
# define an empty list -> list_odd()
# for i = a check if a = 2n+1 (definition of odd number)
# if yes -> put a in the empty list_odd
# if not then  i = i+1 next number in the defined range 
# continue until last number b
# check if b = 2k+1 
# if yes put b in the list_odd

# call function summ(list_odd)
# calculate the summ of the odd numbers in [a;b]
# print the result on the screen.
